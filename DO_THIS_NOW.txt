========================================
?? DO THIS ONE THING - FINAL TEST
========================================

I've opened: simple-test.html

This is a SUPER SIMPLE test with BIG buttons.

========================================
? WHAT TO DO:
========================================

1. Look at the simple-test.html window
2. You'll see:
   - Email field (pre-filled)
   - Password field (pre-filled)
   - TWO BIG BUTTONS: "SIGN IN" and "SIGN UP"

3. Click the GREEN "SIGN UP" button

4. Look at what appears below the buttons

========================================
?? YOU WILL SEE ONE OF TWO THINGS:
========================================

OPTION A: ? SUCCESS
--------------------
"? SUCCESS! Account created for: test@example.com"

? Firebase IS enabled and working!
? Your main app SHOULD work too
? The problem is something else in index.html
? Tell me: "SIMPLE TEST WORKS"

OPTION B: ? ERROR
------------------
"? ERROR: auth/operation-not-allowed"
"?? EMAIL/PASSWORD AUTH IS DISABLED!"

? Firebase IS NOT enabled
? You MUST enable it in Firebase Console
? Tell me: "AUTH NOT ENABLED"

========================================
IF AUTH NOT ENABLED:
========================================

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hrp-wl/authentication/providers

2. Find "Email/Password" in the list

3. Click on it

4. Toggle to ENABLE

5. Click SAVE

6. Come back to simple-test.html

7. Click "SIGN UP" again

8. Should now say: "? SUCCESS!"

========================================
?? JUST TELL ME:
========================================

After you click the GREEN "SIGN UP" button in simple-test.html:

A) Does it say "SUCCESS"?
B) Does it say "ERROR: auth/operation-not-allowed"?
C) Does nothing happen?

That's all I need to know!
