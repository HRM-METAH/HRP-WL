========================================
? FIXED! TEST YOUR MAIN APP NOW
========================================

Since simple-test.html works (all green), I've fixed your main index.html.

The problem was: Event listeners weren't attaching properly.

The fix: Added inline onclick handlers that work immediately.

========================================
?? TEST NOW:
========================================

1. CLOSE all those help files (you don't need them anymore)

2. OPEN: index.html in browser (or refresh if already open)
   Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)

3. YOU SHOULD SEE:
   - Grey overlay blocking page
   - ?? lock icon
   - TWO buttons: "Sign In" and "Sign Up"

4. CLICK: "Sign Up" button (on the overlay)

5. MODAL SHOULD OPEN with:
   - Email field
   - Password field
   - Sign In button
   - Sign Up button

6. ENTER:
   Email: yourname@example.com
   Password: YourPassword123

7. CLICK: "Sign Up" button (in the modal)

8. SHOULD HAPPEN:
   ? "Creating account..." appears
   ? "Account created! Signing in..." appears
   ? Modal closes
   ? Overlay disappears
   ? Top button shows your email
   ? You can now use the app!

========================================
? IF IT WORKS:
========================================

Congratulations! You now have:
- ? Working authentication
- ? Realtime Firebase sync
- ? Multi-device sync
- ? Grey overlay when not signed in
- ? User email displayed when signed in

TEST MULTI-DEVICE SYNC:
1. Open on Computer 1, sign in
2. Open on Computer 2, sign in (same account)
3. Create case on Computer 1
4. See it appear on Computer 2 instantly!

========================================
? IF STILL DOESN'T WORK:
========================================

Open Console (F12) and tell me:
1. Do you see "Button clicked!" when you click Sign Up?
2. Does the modal open?
3. What error messages appear?

========================================
