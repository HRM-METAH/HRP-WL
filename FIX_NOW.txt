========================================
?? BOTH SIGN IN AND SIGN UP NOT WORKING
========================================

This means Email/Password authentication is NOT ENABLED in Firebase Console.

========================================
? FIX IT NOW (2 MINUTES):
========================================

I've opened TWO windows for you:

1?? WINDOW 1: diagnostic.html
   - This will test Firebase and show you the EXACT error

2?? WINDOW 2: Firebase Console
   - This is where you'll enable authentication

========================================
?? DO THESE STEPS IN ORDER:
========================================

STEP 1: In diagnostic.html window
----------------------------------
1. Look at "Step 2: Auth Provider Check"
2. Click "Test Sign Up" button
3. READ THE ERROR MESSAGE

You will see ONE of these:

? ERROR: auth/operation-not-allowed
   ? Email/Password is DISABLED
   ? Go to Step 2 below

? SUCCESS: Account created!
   ? Email/Password is ENABLED
   ? Your main app should work now

STEP 2: In Firebase Console window
----------------------------------
1. You should see a list of Sign-in providers
2. Find "Email/Password" (should be at the top)
3. Check its status:

   ? If it says "Disabled":
      ? Click on the "Email/Password" row
      ? Toggle the switch to ENABLE
      ? Click "Save"
      ? ? DONE!

   ? If it says "Enabled":
      ? It's already on!
      ? The problem is something else
      ? Go to Step 3

STEP 3: Test again in diagnostic.html
--------------------------------------
1. Go back to diagnostic.html
2. Click "Test Sign Up" again
3. You should now see:
   ? Account created successfully!
   ? Email: test@example.com
   ? UID: ...

STEP 4: Test your main app
---------------------------
1. Open index.html (your main app)
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
3. You should see:
   - Grey overlay with ??
   - "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. Enter email and password
6. Click "Sign Up" in modal
7. ? Should work now!

========================================
?? WHAT EACH ERROR MEANS:
========================================

ERROR: auth/operation-not-allowed
? FIX: Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console (Step 2)

ERROR: auth/email-already-in-use
? FIX: Email is taken. Try signing in instead, or use different email

ERROR: auth/weak-password
? FIX: Use password with 6+ characters

ERROR: auth/invalid-email
? FIX: Use valid email format (x@y.com)

ERROR: auth/network-request-failed
? FIX: Check internet connection

ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined
? FIX: Firebase didn't load. Refresh page.

========================================
?? EXPECTED RESULT:
========================================

After enabling Email/Password and testing:

diagnostic.html shows:
? Connected to Firebase
? Account created successfully!
? Email: test@example.com

index.html shows:
? Grey overlay
? Two buttons (Sign In, Sign Up)
? Clicking Sign Up opens modal
? Creating account works
? Overlay disappears
? Top button shows your email

========================================
?? SEND ME:
========================================

1. Screenshot of diagnostic.html after clicking "Test Sign Up"
2. Screenshot of Firebase Console showing Email/Password status
3. Tell me the exact error message you see

Then I can help with the specific issue!

========================================
?? MOST LIKELY ISSUE:
========================================

99% chance: Email/Password authentication is DISABLED in Firebase Console

1% chance: API key is wrong, or Firebase project doesn't exist

========================================
