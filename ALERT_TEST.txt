========================================
?? FINAL DEBUG TEST
========================================

I've added an alert to index.html to see if JavaScript is even running.

========================================
DO THIS:
========================================

1. CLOSE Visual Studio (or close all those help file tabs)

2. OPEN index.html in your BROWSER
   - Double-click index.html
   - Or drag it to Chrome/Edge

3. YOU SHOULD SEE:
   - An ALERT popup saying "JavaScript is loading! If you see this, the script is running."

4. TELL ME:
   A) Do you see that alert? YES or NO
   
========================================
IF YES (you see the alert):
========================================

Click OK on the alert, then:

1. Look at the page
2. Do you see grey overlay with ???
3. Click "Sign Up" button
4. Press F12 (Console)
5. Do you see "Button clicked!" in console?

TELL ME: What happens at each step

========================================
IF NO (you DON'T see the alert):
========================================

Then JavaScript is NOT running AT ALL.

This means:
- You're opening the wrong file
- Browser is blocking JavaScript
- File is corrupted

Try:
1. Right-click index.html
2. Choose "Open with" ? Chrome or Edge
3. Do you NOW see the alert?

========================================
IMPORTANT:
========================================

Close ALL those help files (11 files!)
Just open index.html in BROWSER (not Visual Studio)

The alert will tell us if JavaScript is even running.
